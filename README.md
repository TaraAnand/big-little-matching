# big-little-matching
Implementation of Stable Marriage algorithm to assist in big-little matching for my sorority 

## 
Flaws: the current implementation does not fully account for bigs taking more than one little -- these will have to be matched by hand. 
Because only top 8 preferences are listed, if a little is not mutually ranked by other bigs, it is possible she will not be matched well and should probably be rematched by hand.
